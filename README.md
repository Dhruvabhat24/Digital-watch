# Digital-watch


This Java application creates a simple digital watch using the Swing GUI library. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, with a format of "hh:mm:ss". The watch updates every second to reflect the accurate time. The project utilizes threads for real-time updating and leverages Java's built-in `Calendar` and `SimpleDateFormat` classes for time manipulation and formatting.

**Features:**
- Real-time digital watch display.
- Updates every second to show the accurate time.
- Utilizes Swing for GUI components.
- Threads are employed to ensure smooth real-time updates.
- Time is displayed in a user-friendly "hh:mm:ss" format.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile and run the `DigitalWatch.java` file.
4. The digital watch GUI will open, displaying the current time.

**Note:** This project is a simple demonstration of creating a digital watch using Java Swing and threading. You can use it as a starting point to build more complex applications or enhance the user interface and functionality of the digital watch. Feel free to customize and extend the code as needed for your own projects.
